Contextual information display for Signal K
===========================================

This is an adaptation of the [c-base infoscreens system](https://github.com/c-base/infoscreens) for Signal K. The idea is to enable HTML-capable viewers (like a kiosk display) to show different dashboards depending on whether the boat is sailing, at anchor, etc. This works well for instance with an onboard [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) installation.
